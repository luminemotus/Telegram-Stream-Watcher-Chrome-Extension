## Common Issues and Solutions

   - If the server does not allow CORS requests, the extension might not function properly.
   - Solution: Configure the server or use `background.js` for the requests.

2. **Changes in Telegram DOM Structure**:
   - If Telegram updates its interface, the selectors used in the code might stop working.
   - Solution: Update the selector in the source code.

3. **Insufficient Permissions**:
   - If you don't see messages logged, ensure that `tabs` and `activeTab` permissions are enabled in `manifest.json`.
